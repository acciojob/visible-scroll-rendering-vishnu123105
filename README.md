# Visible Scroll Rendering

Create a component that renders a large list of items, and optimize performance by only rendering the visible items. Use the useRef hook to keep track of the scroll position, and only render the items that are currently visible.

<ins>**NOTE:**</ins>

- Note use `height : "500px"` for scroll container.
- add scrollbars only when necessary.
